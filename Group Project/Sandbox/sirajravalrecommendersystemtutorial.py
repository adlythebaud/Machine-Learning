from lightfm.datasets import fetch_movielens

# 2. get LightFM class which will make a class for us.
from lightfm import LightFM

# 3. get data and format it
 
#lightfm will consider ratings that are 5 as positive and ratings that are 4 and below as negative to make this a binary problem.

# Each user has rated at least 20 movies on a scale of 1-5

# We skipped feature scaling and all that good stuff.
# use a method called loss, which measures difference between model prediction and desired outocome

# warp helps us make recommendations by looking at user rating pairs and making rankings for each of those pairs.

# warp is content and collaborative
