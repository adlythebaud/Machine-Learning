2. What was the most difficult part of this assignment?
The most difficult part was handling missing data and knowing how to use the KNN Regressor

3. Briefly describe your process for handling non-numeric data.
For handling non numeric data, I used a label encoder to quantify each value.

4. Briefly describe your process for missing data.
I used the mode of each column to fill in missing data.

5. Describe your results for the Car Evaluation dataset.
I had accuracy ranging from 89 - 93%

6. Describe your results for the Pima Indian dataset.
I had accuracy ranging from 90-97%

7. Describe your results for the Automobile MPG dataset.
I had very low accuracy, I don't think I used this dataset as well as I could have.

8. Describe anything you did to go above and beyond the minimum standard requirements.


9. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment: C
A - Some attempt was made
B - Developing, but significantly deficient
**** C - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate ****
D - Meets requirements
E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


10. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I was able to load all three data sets, clean up the data and get them ready for training. However,
I took the same approach to all three datasets, and didn't use the regressor the right way.
